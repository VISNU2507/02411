    "- Example: Does adding polymer latex to cement mortar change curing time or strength?\n",
    "- Key idea: Observed differences may be due to:\n",
    "  1. **True treatment effect**\n",
    "  2. **Random variation (noise)**\n",

    "We use **statistical inference** to separate signal from noise.\n",

    "## 2.2 Random Sampling and Sampling Distributions\n",
    "- A **random sample** means each observation is independent and equally likely.\n",

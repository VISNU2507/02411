    "- **Purpose**: Reduce the effect of **nuisance factors** (unwanted variability) on the response.\n",
    "- **Definition**: A nuisance factor is something that influences the response but is **not of primary interest**.\n",
    "- **Typical nuisance factors**: \n",
    "  - Batches of raw material\n",
    "  - Operators\n",
    "  - Test equipment\n",
    "  - Time (shifts, days, etc.)\n",
    "- **Handling strategies**:\n",
    "  - If nuisance factor is **known & controllable** â†’ use **blocking**.\n",
    "  - If **known but uncontrollable** â†’ sometimes use **ANCOVA**.\n",
    "  - If **unknown & uncontrollable** â†’ rely on **randomization**.\n",

    "- **Idea**: Divide experimental units into *blocks* (groups that are internally homogeneous).  \n",
    "- **Design**: Each block contains all treatments (a complete replicate).\n",
    "- **Randomization**: Treatments are randomized *within each block*.\n",
    "- **Effect**: Removes variation due to blocks from the error term.\n",

    "## ðŸ”¹ Latin Square Design\n",
    "- Used when **two nuisance factors** must be controlled simultaneously.  \n",
    "- Structure: $p \\times p$ square, where each treatment appears once in each row and column.  \n",

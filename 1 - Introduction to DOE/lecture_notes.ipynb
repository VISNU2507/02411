    "# 02411 — Design & Analysis of Engineering Experiments\n",
    "## Chapter 1 Notes (Markdown)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instructor:** Murat Kulahci — DTU (IMM) • Course intro slide deck.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is DOE & why it matters\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Experiment:** a test or series of tests to learn about a system or process. Used widely in engineering & physical sciences (process characterization/optimization, material properties, product design, tolerance setting).\n",
    "- **Ultimate goals:**\n",
    "  - Shorten time to design/develop products & processes.\n",
    "  - Improve performance of existing processes.\n",
    "  - Improve product reliability & performance.\n",
    "  - Achieve robustness to variation (products/processes).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## A (very) abbreviated history of DOE\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Agricultural origins (1918–1940s)** — R. A. Fisher & co.; factorial designs, ANOVA; huge impact on agriculture.\n",
    "- **First industrial era (1951–late 1970s)** — Box & Wilson; response surface methods; emphasis on *immediacy* and *sequential* experimentation; strong in chemical/process industries.\n",
    "- **Second industrial era (late 1970s–1990)** — Quality movements; Taguchi methods; robust parameter design and process robustness.\n",
    "- **Modern era (≈1990–)** — Widespread industrial adoption and software support.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notable figures\n",
    "- **William S. Gosset (“Student”)** — Emphasized both improving average yield and breeding for **insensitivity to soil/climate** (robustness).\n",
    "- **R. A. Fisher** — Foundational work in design, randomization, ANOVA; introduced factorial concepts.\n",
    "- **George E. P. Box** — Co-developed response surfaces; championed sequential experimentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Core principles of good experiments\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Randomization**  \n",
    "  Run trials in a **random order** to balance out unmeasured “lurking” variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Replication**  \n",
    "  Provides precision (reduces standard errors) and enables estimation of **pure error/background noise**.  \n",
    "  Distinguish **replicates** (independent runs) vs. **repeat measurements** (multiple reads on the same run).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Blocking**  \n",
    "  Group similar experimental units to handle **nuisance factors** (known sources of variation you’re not studying).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Strategy of experimentation\n",
    "\n",
    "- **“Best-guess” trials:** common and sometimes surprisingly successful, but risk bias and inefficiency.\n",
    "- **One-factor-at-a-time (OFAT):** often aligned with naïve “scientific method,” but **inefficient** and **wrecked by interactions**.\n",
    "- **Statistically designed experiments:** Based on **factorials**; capture interactions; efficient use of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Factorial designs (the workhorse)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition:** test **all combinations** of factor levels. Reveals **main effects** and **interactions**.\n",
    "- **Scaling up:** With many factors, full factorials can be large → use **fractional factorials** to screen efficiently.\n",
    "- **Illustrative “golf experiment”:** (factors like driver, ball, walking vs. riding, beverage, time, weather, spikes, …) emphasizes multi-factor thinking.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Planning → Conducting → Analyzing (the 7-step loop)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Recognize & state the problem** — Are you characterizing, optimizing, or seeking robustness?\n",
    "2. **Select response variable(s)** — mean, variance, or multiple responses as needed.\n",
    "3. **Choose factors, levels, ranges**\n",
    "   - Include **design factors**, **held-constant factors**, and **allowed-to-vary** factors.\n",
    "   - Classify **nuisance factors**: controllable, uncontrollable, or noise.\n",
    "4. **Choose the design** — sample size, run order, and structure (e.g., blocks, factorial vs. fractional).\n",
    "5. **Conduct the experiment** — monitor/mitigate **experimental error** while running.\n",
    "6. **Statistical analysis** — use software and **graphical methods**; perform **residual analysis** & **model adequacy checks**.\n",
    "7. **Conclusions & recommendations** — plan **follow-up/confirmation runs**; proceed **sequentially/iteratively**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Process tips\n",
    "- Involve **statistical thinking early**.\n",
    "- **Subject-matter knowledge** is crucial.\n",
    "- **Pre-experimental planning (Steps 1–3) is vital**.\n",
    "- Think **sequentially**; improve via **confirmation tests**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example motif in class: Paper helicopter\n",
    "\n",
    "- Hands-on platform to demonstrate factors, randomization, replication, response selection, and sequential improvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Quick glossary (from the chapter)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Factor:** controllable input you vary (e.g., temperature). **Level:** specific setting of a factor.\n",
    "- **Response:** output you measure (e.g., yield, time, variance).\n",
    "- **Interaction:** when the effect of one factor depends on the level of another; OFAT easily misses this.\n",
    "- **Nuisance factor:** source of variation not of primary interest; handle via blocking or randomization.\n",
    "- **Robustness:** performance insensitive to noise (echoing Gosset/Taguchi motivation).\n"

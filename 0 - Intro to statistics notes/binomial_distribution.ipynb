    "- The **PMF** of the binomial is sometimes called its **probability density function** (for discrete case).  \n",

    "- When $n$ is large and $p$ is small, the binomial distribution approximates the **Poisson distribution**.  \n",
    "- When $n$ is large and $p$ is not too close to 0 or 1, it approximates the **Normal distribution** with mean $np$ and variance $np(1-p)$.\n"
